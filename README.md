Welcome to WA-Sno-Park TBD.

I originally sketched this out as an idea to show the latest webcam shot for the sno-park, thinking that might be available, and would be a quick way to judge how busy/ready-to-ski each park is.

Instead, this is turning into more of a handy website to consult the morning-of. What was groomed recently, is it worth the drive, is the drive a lot longer than typical, etc.

What it might be good for:
- current drive-time to each park
- see how many miles are available
- filter by day-last-groomed
- filter by groomed/ungroomed
- ???
